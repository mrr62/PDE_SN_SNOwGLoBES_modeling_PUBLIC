this hosts all local code used to generate the proper SNOwGLoBES compatible fluence files from custom energy and luminosity data 
--> has both energy and time binning options Currently run in pycharm, but any python environment should work with only minor environment specific tweaks as needed 
!! also includes interpolation code to create matching luminosity and energy files in the format SNOwGLoBES analysis requires (interpolation)
